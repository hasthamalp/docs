## Lessons

A few lessons I learned in hard way:

* People who are very religious should not be trusted blindly. They actions are unpredictable and without logical explanation. They do not have personal [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity).
* People who behave very politely should not be trusted blindly. They are often pretentious and has bad intentions
* People who say mean things about others and use harsh language about their differences should not be trusted blindly. They will do the same to you and will take anything personally and will turn enemies quickly. 

## Observations

Observations about people's behaviors from my experience.

* The sentences one person write or speak often gives clues about that persons intellectual depth. People who use very short sentence and often phrases instead of sentences are intellectually weak. They usually struggle to articulate relatively non-trivial ideas and events. These people are also often followers of [hatred and extreme right wing ideas](politics/hatred-hinduthwa-nationalism.md).
* If somebody promise something to you and do it on time\(or informs delay or not able to do it\) are people with [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity). If a person does not behave this quality, do not trust them with time sensitive delegations
