I lead various language computing projects at [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing.](http://smc.org.in) Many of my works on Malayalam computing enable millions of Malayalam users on their computers or phones. I maintain a number of free software projects related to Indic language computing too.

I have done significant contributions to [Malayalam digital typography.](fonts/) I have designed two popular Malayalam typefaces named Chilanka and Manjari. Also maintains a number of other Malayalam unicode fonts. You can see all of these fonts in [SMC website](https://smc.org.in/fonts/)

I also received Mathrubhasha Puraskaram 2019 from the [Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit](https://ssus.ac.in/), Kalady.

## Profession

Currently I am working as Principal Software Engineer at Language Engineering team of [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org). I work on MediaWiki language support, internationalization, localization, input methods for large number of languages in which Wikipedia exist, fonts, translation tools etc. I live at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. I work remotely. I joined Wikimedia Foundation in 2011 September 1st.

### Infosys

From 2015 July 10 to July 2011, I worked at [Infosys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys). This was my first job after graduating from engineering college. I mainly worked on Java, J2EE based projects at Infosys for clients like [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus), [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)\(for Boeing Dreamliner\), [General Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors), [Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota) and [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments). When I was resigning, I was working in technology architecture group as junior architect. 

My role was mostly technology troubleshooting and helping senior architects. In the last 2 years at Infosys, I had a rather interesting role as extreme programmer where I was sent to various campuses to help engineering who are miserably failing to deliver on time. I was expected to replace a few engineers, learn the project in a day or two, finish the project as fast as possible. If you think that I need to work weekends and nights for this, you are mistaken :-\). I worked only 8 hours and only 5 days per week in this role. I visited Pune, Bangalore, Chennai offices for this kind of adventures.  I was also part of technical interview teams.

Another interesting project I worked there was for [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments). They wanted a single person with special project budget to work on experimental projects that are technically complex and time sensitive. I helped them to build their electronic component datasheet indexing and searching project using Apache Lucene and Solr.

For a short duration in 2010, I worked for [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.). This was another assignment to help a team missing their deadlines to deliver. I visited Bangalore campus for three months. For that short period of time, I owned the email santhosh at apple.com :-\)
