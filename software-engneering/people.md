* \*\*\*\*[**Alan Turing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) - developed [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science), providing a formalisation of the concepts of [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) and [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) with the [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), which can be considered a model of a [general-purpose computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computer). Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).
  * In 2013,[ I wrote a Malayalam article](https://thottingal.in/documents/turing/) about him and his contributions 
* \*\*\*\*[**Fabrice Bellard**](https://bellard.org): known for creating [FFmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg), [QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU), and [Tiny C Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_C_Compiler) software projects. He developed [Bellard's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellard%27s_formula) for calculating single digits of [pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi).
