# Against PDF

[PDF: Still Unfit for Human Consumption, 20 Years Later](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/) \([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24108950)\)

From [https://practicaltypography.com/why-theres-no-e-book-or-pdf.html](https://practicaltypography.com/why-theres-no-e-book-or-pdf.html) by Matthew Butterick: 

> "_PDF started as a proprietary Adobe file format, but it eventually became an open standard. Today, writers can make PDFs with many tools; readers can view PDFs in many ways. That’s all good._
>
> _What’s bad are the limitations of the format itself. PDF is fundamentally a digital simulation of paper. So it’s great for making paper documents available in the digital realm. But for natively digital documents—like this one—it removes functionality and imposes design constraints._
>
> _Thus, as a format for digital books, I have to vote against PDF. As a typographer, that’s painful, because PDF preserves layout and typography better than the typical e-book formats. In all other respects, however, it’s an example of the Shirky Principle—a backward-looking format that wants to impose yesterday’s constraints on today’s projects. As a reader and writer, that’s not good enough._"
