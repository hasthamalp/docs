# Handwriting Recognition

[Handwriting recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition) can be done while the user is writing\(called online handwriting recognition\) and recognizing a sample somebody wrote in the past\(offline recognition\). Online and offline recognition problems are different problems. This is because, in online recognition, it is possible to capture additional details such as pen up, pen down, pen movement directions and rotations. These details provide an extra advantage on recognition. In offline recognition, we only have a sample written by somebody in the past. It is also important to note that optical character recognition\([OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)\) for printed content on a paper has differences with handwriting recognition. Printed content often have regularities\(single font, uniformly aligned content etc.\)
