# Generative art

## Drawbot

[Drawbot](https://www.drawbot.com/) is a well known python based application for generative art. It also has sevaral use in typeface design. 

Drawbot, however, only works in Mac. Recently [Drawbot Skia](https://github.com/justvanrossum/drawbot-skia) project tries to make it platform independent.
