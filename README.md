# Welcome

This is my personal knowledge space where I try to document and share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://docs.thottingal.in/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/santhoshtr/docs).  I also write blog posts in[ my blog](https://thottingal.in/blog) occassionally, but eventually I organize the content here and try to keep it updated. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while here it is living document.

My native language is Malayalam. So you will see good amount of content in this space written in Malayalam.
