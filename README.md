# Welcome

This is my personal knowledge space where I try to document and share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://docs.thottingal.in/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/santhoshtr/docs).  I also write blog posts in[ my blog](https://thottingal.in/blog) occassionally, but eventually I organize the content here and try to keep it updated. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while here it is living document.

My native language is Malayalam. So you will see good amount of content in this space written in Malayalam. 

**But who am I? If you are curious, please read this brief self introduction:**

## Grow your own digital garden ðŸŒ± <a id="grow-your-own-digital-garden"></a>

I got inspiration from [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) to start this space.  These kind of wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/). [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/)  has a list of [such wikis](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.

If you found a mistake anywhere, I would appreciate your help. GitBook provides a quick way to open GitHub page for any entry so you can make changes and submit a PR.

I'd love to hear any [ideas you have](https://github.com/santhoshtr/docs/issues) on how I can improve this wiki.
